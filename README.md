# Zoo

## Part 1

There is a zoo, and in that zoo there are 4 kind of animals. There are lions, tigers, giraffes, and gazelles. Some of these animals eat meat and hunt. Some eat plants and they go out to graze. The zookeeper can send them home and the keeper needs to know if they are home. Each animal goes to a different kind of home; for example a tiger goes to a den.</br>

Following classes are implemented:

## Part 3

A new zoo director is hired and the new director decided that all animals and plants need to have a serial id. A serial id is a unique number which identifies all animals and plants.
- A serial id for a school of fish is defined as: school id and how many fish are in this school.

The director wants to be able to:</br>
- to send the animals out to eat or home.
- ask the animals where they are. Animal and plants are at x/y positions in the Zoo. X/y can describe a large area.
- move the animals and moveable plants to new positions.

The zoo has:
- a Polar Bear which is a Carnivore,
- an Alpaca which is a Herbivore,
- an Aardvark which is a Omnivore,
- one school of gold fish,
