# Zoo

## Part 1

There is a zoo, and in that zoo there are 4 kind of animals. There are lions, tigers, giraffes, and gazelles. Some of these animals eat meat and hunt. Some eat plants and they go out to graze. The zookeeper can send them home and the keeper needs to know if they are home. Each animal goes to a different kind of home; for example a tiger goes to a den.</br>
